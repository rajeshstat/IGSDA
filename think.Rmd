This is a work flow and thinking document for the IGSDA project.

Advantages for developing this project.

1. Increased understanding of satistical methods.
2. Understanding the conputational nuances of variaous methods which would lead to greater understanding.
3. Developing a an automatic method without need of a statisticaian to analyze the data, as we can take into consideration all possible information and make the same decision as any statistician would.
4. Learning julia language.
4. Programming in julia for speed can help understand the computational aspect of statistical algorithms better.

Disadvantages
1. This is going to take lot of time. (should be worth it)
2. Julia is not yet fully developed.


Use Rjulia for interfacing julia to R
```{r}

```
